    <p>My first 4 days at Akirachix were eventful and full of happiness.I was oveerjoyed on arrival to AkiraChix because now,<br/> I have 
        a chance to change my life and make my future literally. My parents and small brother accompanied me and were also <br/>very optimistic.
         Although they had there doubts, this was cleared after they talked with Linda, who is the managing director. Food was <br/> served to them and before 
         that, we were welcomed with tea. It was such a warm welcome that will be commemorated in our minds for a while. </p>
